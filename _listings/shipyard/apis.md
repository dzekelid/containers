name: Shipyard
description: Built on the Docker cluster management toolkit Citadel, Shipyard gives
  you the ability to manage Docker resources including containers, hosts and more.
  Shipyard differs from other management applications in that it promotes composability.
  At the core, Shipyard only manages Docker (containers, etc). However, using Extension
  Images you can add functionality such as application routing and load balancing,
  centralized logging, deployment and more. You decide which components to use that
  fit your needs.
